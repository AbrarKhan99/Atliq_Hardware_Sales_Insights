## Overview

Atliq Hardware is a prominent company that supplies computer hardware and peripherals across various regions in India. The sales director of Atliq Hardware is facing challenges in understanding the sales performance of the company's branches in different regions. The regional managers were providing sales data in tons of Excel files, making it difficult to gain insights quickly. To overcome this hurdle, I as a data analyst was asked to create an interactive dashboard that offers valuable insights into the sales performance of the respective regions.

## Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes the sales data effectively. The dashboard needed to provide real-time insights to the sales director, enabling him to understand the sales trends, identify top-performing regions, and make data-driven decisions.

## Steps Taken

### Step 1: Analyzing Data Using MySQL

To begin the project, I uploaded the provided data files into MySQL for a deeper understanding of the sales figures. After conducting a thorough analysis, I discovered that the sales were declining year over year.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning and Modeling in Power BI

To prepare the data for visualization, I loaded the data files into Power BI and performed data cleaning tasks. This involved removing unwanted rows, ensuring proper naming of column headers, and converting transactions in USD to INR. Additionally, data modeling was done to optimize data relationships, laying the foundation for accurate visualizations.

### Step 3: Data Visualization in Power BI

The most exciting part of the project was creating captivating visualizations. I designed a two-page report, where one page showcased key insights and the other page focused on profit analysis. I used DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create custom measures to calculate metrics like YoY growth, regional sales performance, and profitability.

## Dashboard Insights

**Page 1 - Key Insights**

- **Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales Trends:** Visualized line charts and bar graphs to showcase the YoY sales trends for each region, helping identify growth or decline patterns.
- **Top Performing Regions:** Utilized pie chart to highlight the Revenue contribution % by zone.

**Page 2 - Profit Analysis**

- **Profit Margin Analysis:** Represented profit margins across zones using a pie chart, aiding in understanding which zones contribute most to overall profitability.
- **Product-wise Profitability:** Created a clustered column chart to illustrate the last year's revenue generated compared to the current year's revenue generated.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Power BI file (Sales Insights - Report.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
3. Explore the visualizations on both pages to gain valuable insights into Atliq Hardware's sales performance.

## Future Improvements

This dashboard is an initial version, and there are several potential improvements and enhancements that can be made:

1. Adding interactive filters for users to explore data based on specific regions, time frames, or product categories.
2. Incorporating real-time data integration to ensure the dashboard is always up-to-date.
3. Implementing advanced analytics and machine learning models to predict future sales trends and optimize inventory management.

## Conclusion

The Atliq Hardware Sales Dashboard is a powerful tool that provides meaningful insights into the company's sales performance. With this dashboard, the sales director can make informed decisions, identify growth opportunities, and address any challenges faced by the company in different regions.
